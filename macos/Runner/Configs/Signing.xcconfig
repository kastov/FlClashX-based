// Can be overridden by Local.xcconfig (copy from Local.xcconfig.example)
// or by environment variables in CI/CD

// For local development, copy Local.xcconfig.example to Local.xcconfig
// and set your credentials there (it's gitignored)
#include? "Local.xcconfig"

// In CI/CD, these are set via environment variables in GitHub Actions
// The certificate is imported into keychain, and Xcode automatically finds it
// CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY will be set from APPLE_DEVELOPER_ID secret
